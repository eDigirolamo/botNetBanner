BAN BOTS 

THIS ASSUMES wget and jq are installed, if not, further assumed you can and will install those 2 things. 

Ban amazon EC2 instances (or others if you so choose). I found hundreds of these ip's visiting a site every wednesday @ 3am spiking traffic, and exponentially increasing bounce rate. Effectively a reverse SEO tactic (it actually worked). Google claims bounce rate isn't related to rankings but.... first handle knowledge and experience proves otherwise, rankings dropped ~ 5 points and slowly like the whole boiling frog scenario. The only way to know and spot this to to filter analytics from geographical region......BROADMAN OREGON or ASHBURN VA.....AMAZAON DATACENTER LOCATIONS.....
